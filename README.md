# Project Quack Project

This is a team project for SBCS's Project Quack program during the 2024-25 season.

## Project Timeline

This section will track progress on the project.

### TODO for 20 November 2024

Everyone should be able to show the following during the next meeting:

Continuing in the branch you created for Step 1
- [ ] When the user presses space, fill the area the player is in with a random color
    - [ ] If completed easily, figure out how to "mix" colors, i.e. if the user presses space twice, filling the already-filled area with a second color, figure out how to calculate a "mix" of the existing color and new color, and then fill the area with that mix.
        - One paper I found: `http://nishitalab.org/user/UEI/publication/Sugita_IWAIT2015.pdf`
- [x] Define a `n x n` 2D array as the map for the game, with 1/0 (or true/false, "X"/"O") being impassable squares/passable squares
- [x] Draw the `n x n` map with one color being impassable squares, and another being passable squares
- [x] Create a player (as a circle, square, etc.) that starts in the middle of the board
    - [x] Player should move in the passable squares one square at a time depending on ULDR arrows / WASD keyboard input
- [x] Create a git branch in the project-quack repository titled using your name
- [x] Do the following within your branch
    - [x] Have .html and .js files (.css if applicable) within the branch
    - [x] Loaded p5.js library into the .html file (see p5.js use directions)
    - [x] Create a 800x800 canvas
    - [x] Show an 8x8 checkerboard pattern on the screen
    - [x] Push the final result into the origin branch (do not merge with main)
- [x] Feel proud you just learned a lot!
